                <h1>DAMILI FESTIVAL DANCE</h1>
                <p>The Damili Festival is an annual celebration in San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte that showcases the town's traditions. The festival usually takes place in the last week of December, and its highlight is the Damili Street Dance and Showdown Competition, which is typically held on December 28. 
                    The festival is centered around the tradition of panagdamili, or pottery making, which is a primary source of livelihood for the people of San Nicolas. The town's economy improved when the people discovered the value of clay and began making earthen pots and other useful items. The clay pot, or banga, became the town's trade symbol. 
                    San Nicolas is now a popular destination for business and investment, and its people continue to celebrate their cultural traditions.</p>
